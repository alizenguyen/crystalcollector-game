# CrystalCollector-Game

### Overview

Homework assignment focusing primarily the applications of jQuery. 

In this assignment, we were asked to create an interactive game for web browsers that dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

### Summary

The game will begin with four crystals. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. When clicked, the player's score counter will update. The player wins if their total score matches the random number form the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts wheenver the player wins or loses. 

When the game starts over, the player will see a new random number. Each crystal will have a new value, and the user's score will reset to zero. The app will also update the numbwer of games the player wins and loses.
